      <p>Hi, I am Aleksandr Beliun, a freelance web designer, front-end developer, Android platform developer and some other. I am from Lithuania, born in a small town called Visaginas and currently I live study in Denmark. I am studying to become a Bachelor of Engineering in ICT (Information and Communication Technology).</p>
      <p>Ever since I had a contact with technology I can't get enough of it. I have followed my dream and after graduating from school I enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) of Information and Communication Technology, challenging my confidence, independency and knowledge. During my time spent studying, I have learned a lot of new things, and experience in various spheres of IT â€“ web and databases, embedded, real time programming as well as enterprise system programing.
</p>
      <p>
        As a person I am highly self-motivated, always looking for something new to experience, dedicated, goal-oriented, open-minded, ambitious and curious. I have experienced working individually during my career as a freelancer as well as teamwork during course assignments and semester projects during my studies. I have become more confident and well adaptive in both situations/environments. </p>
      <p>When I am not looking at the screen of my computer, i love to go running in the nature, workout at the gym, socialize with people or just enjoy the beauty of nature and relax in a park. I am passionate about cooking and spend quite a lot of time in the kitchen cooking or eating. </p>
